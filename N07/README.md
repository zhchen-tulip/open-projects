# `NEXUS` Topological Data Analysis 

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as potent tools, leveraging extracted topological features as inputs for machine (deep) learning or as valuable complements, demonstrating notable eﬀicacy across various applications, including biology, materials science, computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). Persistent homology (PH) is a powerful tool in TDA for studying topological features and patterns (e.g., connected components, loops, voids) in data across multiple scales, so-called the notion of filtration. However, PH has follwing limitations: (i) diﬀicultly to get a correct Persistent Diagram (PD) based on the original structure of the object, (ii) ineﬀiciently in large scale dataset.
