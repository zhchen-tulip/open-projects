# TULIP-Lab Open Projects

- This series of projects was originally established as the assignments and capstone projects for **elite class** students, the research projects for **master** students or **honours** students, in some top Australiasia universities, including [Deakin University](http://wwww.deakin.edu.au), [Manipal Institute of Technology](https://www.manipal.edu), [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), [Southeast University](http://www.seu.edu.cn), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ucas.edu.cn), [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](http://www.njust.edu.cn), [Vellor Institute of Technology](http://www.vit.ac.in), [SRM Institute of Science & Technology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/) etc. (since 2012).

## :bulb: Content

The purpose of this series of **open projects** is to help solve a real-world AI project using (but not limited to) modern AI methods. Each project is designed to:
- help you get experience in following cutting edge research and writing academic report.
- help you gain hands-on experience in solving real projects;

### :ledger: Assignment Projects

The following projects are recommended as:  
- assignments for elite class students
- capstone projects for Bachelor and Master by coursework students

You are free to choose any project from the recommended lists. Most of those can be considered as assignments, typically, for which you are required to:
-  implement the project as required, maintain your own GitHub repository.
-  complete a report on your method (with adequate justification), your discovery, empirical evaluation and analysis.
-  deliver and publish (via services such as [YouTube](www.youtube.com)) a  demonstration on your project.  

More detailed requirements for assignments, please follow their [corresponding units'](https://github.com/tulip-lab#man_teacher-courses) requirements.

## :ledger: `NEXUS` Projects

`NEXUS` projects are established for the [`NEXUS` research training program](https://github.com/tulip-lab#runner-nexus-research-training), supervised by [TULIP-Lab members](https://www.tulip.org.au/members). Every project has its own specific requirements, which can be accessed from the corresponding project pages.
