The landscape of commercial Reinforcement Learning (RL) services has expanded significantly, offering platforms that empower users, even those without expertise in RL, to effortlessly construct policy models tailored to their specific task environments. However, a prevalent issue arises when users, relying on provided codebases, train policy models without a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This lack of insight into how the models operate introduces a significant risk of privacy breaches, as sensitive information may inadvertently be exposed during the training process.

This research delves into the privacy vulnerabilities inherent in RL systems. Our objective is to unveil novel types of privacy invasion attack perpetrated by attackers masquerading as malicious RL service providers. Their goal is to clandestinely extract confidential information about the users' training environments, leveraging the trust placed in these commercial services. The study not only highlights the feasibility of such privacy-stealing tactics, but also ignites a broader discussion on developing robust defense mechanisms. By exploring potential strategies to thwart these privacy-compromising attacks, we aim to **fortify the security of RL services and protect the privacy of their users, ensuring a safer environment for the advancement of reinforcement learning applications**.
