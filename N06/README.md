Optimal Transportation, also known as the Earth Mover's Distance, is a powerful concept in mathematics that deals with finding the most efficient way to move or redistribute resources from one configuration to another. It essentially aims to determine the optimal plan for transporting a mass or probability distribution from its initial state to a desired target state while minimizing the total cost or effort involved. The idea behind optimal transportation is to imagine that you have two piles of earth (or any other material) with different shapes and distributions, and you need to reshape one pile into the other by moving the earth. The challenge is to find the most efficient way to do this, minimizing the total distance or cost of moving the earth from one location to another.

Optimal transportation theory provides a mathematical framework and algorithms to solve such problems, allowing for the comparison and alignment of probability distributions, which has numerous applications in various fields. For instance, it can be used in machine learning for tasks like image retrieval, shape matching, and data analysis, as well as in computer vision, natural language processing, economics, and physics.

Overall, optimal transportation theory offers a powerful mathematical framework for addressing problems involving the redistribution or alignment of resources, mass, or probability distributions, making it a valuable tool in various domains where such problems arise.
