Label Distribution Learning (LDL) offers a framework for assigning probabilistic labels to instances, representing a shift from traditional labeling methods by incorporating data's inherent uncertainties for enhanced representation. The introduction of label enhancement techniques responds to the widespread use of hard labels in datasets, which, despite their simplicity, do not capture the granularity of probabilistic soft labels that provide a detailed understanding of data. Generating soft labels manually is resource-intensive, highlighting the need for a more efficient solution. Label enhancement bridges the gap between hard labels and the comprehensive insights offered by soft labels by deriving probabilistic distributions from hard-labeled data, thus avoiding the high costs of manual annotation. This method enriches label information and improves the training data's quality for machine learning models. The application of optimal transport theory in label enhancement introduces a methodical approach to refine label distributions efficiently, aiming to *reduce discrepancies between soft and hard labels while maintaining data integrity and mitigating label uncertainty, thereby enhancing data annotation and model performance with LDL*.
