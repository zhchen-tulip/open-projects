# `NEXUS` Tabular Data Generation

Nowadays, Generative Adversarial network (GAN) model and its variants are widely utilized in a wide range of domains ranging from Computer Vision, Data Privacy,  Medicine etc. due to their excellent performance when compared to other methods. Typical GAN models constitute of two components: the  Generator learns to produce a synthetic output from the input noise, whereas the  Discriminator learns to distinguish the generator's synthetic data from the real one. These two components interact with each other based on a game theoretic algorithm such that as the training continues, the generator learns to produce better and better synthetic data, and the discriminator learns to more accurately distinguish between the synthetic and the real data. Typically, the generator and the discriminator components are modelled as deep Artificial Neural Networks, with the convolution and dense layers. Though, their application to synthetic data generation for computer vision tasks is ground-breaking, their application to tabular data generation, has been marred with challenges. Of course, the main challenge stems from the fact that no explicit structure is available among the input data features which can be exploited by the convolutional layers, leaving the responsibility to dense layers to engineer features in order to capture the correlation among features. Note, that tabular datasets mainly consist of categorical and numeric features. How to seamlessly handle these different feature types is not trivial.

Regardless of the challenge, application of GAN to tabular data generation has seen promising results, with models like CTGAN, Pate-GAN leading to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. The current research on the application of GAN models for the tabular synthetic data generation has taken three directions: The first direction utilizes the vanilla {GAN} structure, whereas the second direction utilizes the conditional models based on conditional GAN structure. The last direction is to use the discriminative Bayesian Networks for generating the tabular synthetic data.
